                <h2 style="align-items: center;">Construction</h2>
                <p>The term ‘renovation’ refers to the process of returning something to a good state of repair. In the construction industry, renovation refers to the process of improving or modernising an old, damaged or defective building. This is as opposed to 'retrofitting' which is providing something with a component or feature not originally fitted, or 'refurbishment' which is a process of improvement by cleaning, decorating, or re-equipping</p>

                <h2 style="align-items: center;">Roofing</h2>

                <p>A roof is the top covering of a building, including all materials and constructions necessary to support it on the walls of the building or on uprights, providing protection against rain, snow, sunlight, extremes of temperature, and wind.[1] A roof is part of the building envelope.

                    The characteristics of a roof are dependent upon the purpose of the building that it covers, the available roofing materials and the local traditions of construction and wider concepts of architectural design and practice and may also be governed by local or national legislation.</p>

                <h2 style="align-items: center;">Remodeling</h2>
                <p>Remodeling is defined as altering a structure, whether this alteration is exterior or interior, from the original construction. Some examples of remodeling are, but are not limited to:

                    Completely transforming the structure and/or style of any space, home, or building.
                    Changing the layout, in part or in whole, of any space, room, or garage area from the original floor plan.</p>

                <h2 style="align-items: center;">Solar Installation</h2>

                <p>Solar energy begins with the sun. Solar panels (also known as "PV panels") are used to convert light from the sun, which is composed of particles of energy called "photons", into electricity that can be used to power electrical loads.

                    Solar panels can be used for a wide variety of applications including remote power systems for cabins, telecommunications equipment, remote sensing, and of course for the production of electricity by residential and commercial solar electric systems.</p>

                <h2 style="align-items: center;">Plumbing</h2>
                <p>Plumbing is any system that conveys fluids for a wide range of applications. Plumbing uses pipes, valves, plumbing fixtures, tanks, and other apparatuses to convey fluids. Heating and cooling (HVAC), waste removal, and potable water delivery are among the most common uses for plumbing, but it is not limited to these applications. The word derives from the Latin for lead, plumbum, as the first effective pipes used in the Roman era were lead pipes.</p>

                <h2 style="align-items: center;">Electrical</h2>
                <p>An electrical contractor is a business person or firm that performs specialized construction work related to the design, installation, and maintenance of electrical systems.[1] An electrical contractor is different from an electrician; an electrician is an individual tradesman and an electrical contractor is a business person or company that employs electricians. Both usually hold licenses and insurances to properly and safely operate a business, protecting the employees and home owners/business owners from insurance liabilities.</p>
